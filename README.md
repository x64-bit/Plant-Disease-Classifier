# Plant-Disease-Classifier
--
## Overview
This repository will eventually house my 2020 science fair project. 
The minimum goal for this year is to train a CNN on the PlantVillage dataset in order to classify plant diseases. The overarching goal would be to design a drone capable of automating agricultural surveyal for its owner, featuring soil analysis and data visualization.

I'm currently debating as to whether to use transfer learning or create my own architecture. The former would likely be more accurate, but it takes the fun (and stress, I suppose) out of the project...
